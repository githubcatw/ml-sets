# class-devices
Images of different devices from 3 manufacturers (Apple, Samsung, Microsoft).

Apple device images from https://everyi.com/

Samsung device images from https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung-phones-f-9-0-r1-p1.php

Microsoft device images from https://www.gsmarena.com/res.php3?sSearch=lumia

I've made a ```devices``` folder containing all of the device images. Use that folder to train your classifier.
